# FGDC_servicelist_GP
List of services tagged in Geoplatform that are being checked through FGDC Status Checker.
The "GP_services.R" script is for automating the process. The script grabs the necessary information of the services
in the resilience community and outputs them into a csv file. Once in the CSV, you can export them as an XML file using the XML
"all_service_info.xml" file as the appropriate mapping file. Once overwritten into the document, copy and paste the XML information
into the github service info file. FGDC takes the raw github atom feed to check the services daily and produce a report.
